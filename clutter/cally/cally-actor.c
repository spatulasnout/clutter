 * @Title: CallyActor
 * @short_description: Implementation of the ATK interfaces for #ClutterActor

 *
 * #CallyActor implements the required ATK interfaces of #ClutterActor
 * exposing the common elements on each actor (position, extents, etc).

/*
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 *
 * ####
 *
 * Focus: clutter hasn't got the focus concept in the same way that GTK, but it
 * has a key focus managed by the stage. Basically any actor can be focused using
 * clutter_stage_set_key_focus. So, we will use this approach: all actors are
 * focusable, and we get the currently focused using clutter_stage_get_key_focus
 * This affects focus related stateset and some atk_componenet focus methods (like
 * grab focus)
 *
 * ####
 *
 * #ClutterContainer : cally_actor implements some of his methods based on
 * #ClutterContainer interface, although there are the posibility to not
 * implement it. Could be strange to do that but:
 *   * Some methods (like get_n_children and ref_child) are easily implemented using
 *     this interface so a general implementation can be done
 *   * #ClutterContainer is a popular interface, so several classes will implement
 *     that.
 *   * So we can implement a a11y class similar to GailContainer for each clutter
 *     object implementing that, and their clutter subclasses will have a proper
 *     a11y class, but not if they are parallel classes (ie: #ClutterGroup,
 *     #TinyFrame, #TinyScrollView)
 *   * So, on all this objects, will be required to reimplement again some methods
 *     on the objects.
 *   * A auxiliar object (a kind of a11y specific #ClutterContainer implementation)
 *     could be used to implement this methods in only a place, anyway, this will
 *     require some code on each concrete class to manage it.
 *   * So this implementation is based in that is better to manage a interface
 *     on the top abstract object, instead that C&P some code, with the minor
 *     problem that we need to check if we are implementing or not the interface.
 *
 * This methods can be reimplemented, in concrete cases that we can get ways more
 * efficient to implement that. Take a look to #CallyGroup as a example of this.
 *
 * Anyway, there are several examples of behaviour changes depending of the current
 * type of the object you are granting access.
 *
 * TODO,FIXME: check if an option would be to use a dynamic type, as
 * it has been done on the webkit a11y implementation:
 *      See: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21546
 *
 * ###
 *
 * #AtkAction implementation: on previous releases ClutterActor added
 * the actions "press", "release" and "click", as at that time some
 * general-purpose actors like textures were directly used as buttons.
 *
 * But now, new toolkits appeared, providing high-level widgets, like
 * buttons. So in this environment, it doesn't make sense to keep
 * adding them as default.
 *
 * Anyway, current implementation of AtkAction is done at CallyActor
 * providing methods to add and remove actions. This is based on the
 * one used at gailcell, and proposed as a change on #AtkAction
 * interface:
 *
 *  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=649804
